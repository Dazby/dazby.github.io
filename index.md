# The tooth fairy - Frequently Asked Questions

## Who is the tooth fairy?
The tooth fairy is a fairy that collects teeth from children. The tooth fairy will leave money behind as a thank you!

## What to do if the tooth has been swallowed?
Check your poop! The tooth will pass through yuor system and eventually come out the other side. The tooth fairy pays less for poopy teeth though, so be careful...

## What to do if I lose my tooth?
It happens! Sometimes you're so excited to show your friends and family and nanas and grandads that a tooth can go missing. Maybe you didn't notice it fell out until it was already gone! Don't worry though, the tooth fairy understands. If you leave a note called an I.O.U. written in your finest handwriting with your favourite pen, the tooth fairy will accept that instead. After all, the tooth fairy can turn the paper into a box to hold all their other teeth, so it's still useful!

## What if I lose my tooth on Christmas Eve?
Uh oh! If you lose your tooth on Christmas Eve then Santa and the tooth fairy have to fight to see who gives you a present or money. Usually the tooth fairy wins because they throw teeth at Santa, who is very afraid of them and runs away!

Only kidding! If you lose your tooth on Christmas Eve then you are visited by both the tooth fairy AND Santa! Lucky you!
